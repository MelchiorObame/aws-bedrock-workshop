    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **When to use each approach:**\n",
    "- **Manual sequential**: Simple 2-3 step processes where you need full control\n",
    "- **Workflow tool**: Complex processes with parallel tasks and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ **Performance benefits:**\n",
    "- Parallel processing can significantly reduce total execution time\n",
    "- Dependencies ensure tasks run in the right order\n",
    "- Priorities control which ready tasks run first\n",
    "\n",
    "🏗️ **Design patterns you learned:**\n",
    "1. **Sequential pipeline**: A → B → C (like our product analysis)\n",
    "2. **Fan-out, fan-in**: A → [B,C,D] → E (like code review)\n",
    "3. **Complex dependencies**: Mixed parallel and sequential (like blog pipeline)\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Next steps:**\n",
    "- Try building workflows for your own use cases\n",
    "- Experiment with different dependency patterns\n",
    "- Monitor execution times to optimize performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Workflows are like project management for AI agents. Start simple, then add complexity as needed!"
