      "AWS has introduced Amazon Bedrock, a new service that provides access to foundation models (FMs) from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon through an API. Bedrock aims to simplify the process of building and scaling generative AI applications using these models, making it accessible to all developers. The service offers a variety of powerful models for text and images, including Amazon's Titan FMs, which comprise two new large language models (LLMs). Bedrock is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure, managed by AWS. It features a serverless experience that allows users to find suitable models, start quickly, customize models with their own data, and integrate and deploy them into applications using familiar AWS tools and capabilities, without needing to manage any infrastructure. Additionally, Bedrock integrates with Amazon SageMaker ML features such as Experiments and Pipelines for testing and managing models at scale.\n"

    "**Note:** *This notebook can be run within or outside of AWS environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Context\n",
    "To demonstrate the code generation capability of Amazon Bedrock, we will explore the use of the unified Converse API. We will demonstrate different configurations available as well as how simple input can lead to desired outputs. We will explore code generation for two use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python code generation for analytical QnA\n",
    "2. SQL query generation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In both use cases, we will simply provide the Amazon Bedrock API with an input consisting of a task, an instruction and an input for the model under the hood to generate an output without providing any additional example. The purpose here is to demonstrate how the powerful LLMs easily understand the task at hand and generate compelling outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use case 1 - Python code generation for Analytical QnA\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the generation capability of models in Amazon Bedrock, let's take the use case of code generation with Python to do some basic analytical QnA.\n",

    "##### Persona\n",
    "\n",
    "You are Moe, a Data Analyst, at AnyCompany. The company wants to understand its sales performance for different products over the past year. You have been provided a dataset named sales.csv. The dataset contains the following columns:\n",

    "- Date (YYYY-MM-DD) format\n",
    "- Product_ID (unique identifier for each product)\n",
    "- Price (price at which each product was sold)\n",

    "We will simply provide the Amazon Bedrock API with an input consisting of a task, an instruction and an input for the model to generate an output without providing any additional examples. The purpose here is to demonstrate how the powerful LLMs easily understand the task at hand and generate compelling outputs.\n",

    "### Conclusion on Entity Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity extraction is a powerful technique which can extract arbitrary data from plain text descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful when you need to extract specific data which doesn't have clear structure. In such cases regex and other traditional extraction techniques can be very difficult to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Challenges\n",
    "-  Review the [Claude prompt guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design) that includes prompt-engineering best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task is to complete the prompts in the following functions based on the prompt techniques you read in the Claude Prompt Guide. The examples use product categorization - \n",
    "classifying items into categories such as Kitchen Appliances, Electronics, Home & Garden, or Sports & Outdoors. Review the results and explore the effects of\n",
    "different techniques on the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For testing, modify the prompts, uncomment the run_all_examples() line, and execute the cell."
