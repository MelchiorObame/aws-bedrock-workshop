    "# Lab 0 - Introduction to Nova Sonic via AWS Console\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Browser Compatibility Notice**: This lab requires **Google Chrome browser** for optimal performance. Please ensure you're using Chrome before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Amazon Nova Sonic! Before diving into code, let's explore Nova Sonic's capabilities through the AWS Console's interactive playground. This hands-on introduction will help you understand the model's behavior, voice options, and conversational abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Amazon Nova Sonic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova Sonic is AWS's state-of-the-art speech-to-speech AI model that enables natural, real-time conversational experiences. Unlike traditional text-based chatbots, Nova Sonic processes voice input directly and responds with natural-sounding speech, creating seamless voice interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "- **Real-time Speech Processing**: Direct speech-to-speech without intermediate text conversion\n",
    "- **Natural Conversations**: Supports interruptions (barge-in) and contextual understanding\n",
    "- **Multiple Voice Options**: Choose from various voice personalities\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Can call external functions and APIs during conversations\n",
    "- **Guardrails Support**: Built-in responsible AI features"

    "## Understanding the Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Nova Sonic Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional voice assistants that follow this flow:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Speech → Text (ASR) → LLM Processing → Text → Speech (TTS)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nova Sonic uses direct speech-to-speech processing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Speech → Nova Sonic → Speech\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Lower latency\n",
    "- More natural prosody and intonation\n",
    "- Better handling of non-verbal cues\n",
    "- Reduced error propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event-Based Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use Nova Sonic programmatically (which you'll do in the next labs), it operates through a series of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Events**: Audio chunks, text inputs, tool results\n",
    "2. **Processing**: Real-time speech understanding and generation\n",
    "3. **Output Events**: Audio responses, transcripts, tool calls\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll explore this architecture in detail in the next exercise."

    "```\n",
    "You are an enthusiastic life coach. Be warm, encouraging, and motivational. \n",
    "Share practical advice with positive energy. Use conversational language and \n",
    "show genuine interest in helping people grow.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Warm, encouraging tone\n",
    "- Motivational language\n",
    "- Personal, conversational style\n",
    "- May include phrases like \"That's a great question!\" or \"You've got this!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Concise Business Consultant\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are a business efficiency consultant. Provide clear, actionable advice in \n",
    "3-4 sentences maximum. Focus on practical, results-oriented recommendations. \n",
    "Use professional language and get straight to the point.\n",

    "- Professional, no-nonsense tone\n",
    "- Actionable bullet points or specific strategies\n",
    "- No extra elaboration\n",
    "\n",

    "### Example 3: Socratic Teacher\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are a thoughtful teacher who uses the Socratic method. Instead of giving \n",
    "direct answers, ask thought-provoking questions to help users discover insights \n",
    "themselves. Be patient, curious, and guide through inquiry.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test with the same question.**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to Test Barge-In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask a question that will generate a long response:\n",
    "   **\"Tell me everything you know about machine learning and artificial intelligence\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. While Nova is speaking, interrupt by saying:\n",
    "   **\"Wait, stop! I just want to know about neural networks\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Observe how Nova:\n",
    "   - Stops speaking immediately\n",
    "   - Acknowledges the interruption\n",
    "   - Responds to your new question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Applications:**\n",
